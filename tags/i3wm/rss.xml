      <description>Sometimes I want to change the status (i3status) of i3wm temporarily, but it seems that i3wm doesn&amp;#39;t support it directly, although reloading the config for i3wm itself is a piece of cake (bindsym $mod+Shift+c reload in the config, or i3-msg -t command reload in the command line).
