      <description>In this blog post, I&amp;#39;d like to share a bookmarklet for copying a web page&amp;#39;s URL as an org-mode link on Firefox, Chrome, or whatever web browsers support bookmarklets.&#xA;It&amp;#39;s handy when the URL isn&amp;#39;t SEO-friendly, which means you can&amp;#39;t tell what its content is about at first glance of the URL. So a little description text on the link would help.&#xA;Here is the bookmarklet:&#xA;javascript:window.prompt(&amp;#34;Copy to clipboard: Ctrl+C, Esc&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;[[&amp;#34; + document.</description>

      <description>There are times that I need to open many web pages of some specific websites within a browser, and there are so many tabs that I can&amp;#39;t efficiently access one of them, as their favicons are all the same.&#xA;So I tried to find a way to rename their titles, preferably in a lightweight way, so that I can spot them quickly with my eyes.&#xA;The first thought came into my mind was to find some browser extensions to do the job.</description>
