      <description>One of Docker&amp;#39;s use cases is to set up identical development environments easily and quickly for a dev team. Recently, I had an opportunity to give it a try, and build Docker images for Qtile, as it didn&amp;#39;t have one yet as I get involved. With the images, it&amp;#39;s easy to set up the environment to easily run the tests, and build the documentation.&#xA;The best way to have a basic idea of Docker is to think it like a chroot environment, as Chris Tankersley stated in his Docker for Developers.</description>
