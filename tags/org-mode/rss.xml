      <description>Long story short, I came up with an idea to emphasize content while I was reviewing an org-mode document a few months ago after I was tired of typing tedious * around the content repeatedly. And I&amp;#39;ve been longing for this feature since then, because I was unfamiliar with mouse-based key bindings, and neither did I have the time to investigate it.&#xA;Today I finally nailed it down while I was attending a boring meeting, and it turned out to be quite simple.</description>

      <title>A Bookmarklet for Copying a Link as an Org-mode Link</title>

      <description>In this blog post, I&amp;#39;d like to share a bookmarklet for copying a web page&amp;#39;s URL as an org-mode link on Firefox, Chrome, or whatever web browsers support bookmarklets.&#xA;It&amp;#39;s handy when the URL isn&amp;#39;t SEO-friendly, which means you can&amp;#39;t tell what its content is about at first glance of the URL. So a little description text on the link would help.&#xA;Here is the bookmarklet:&#xA;javascript:window.prompt(&amp;#34;Copy to clipboard: Ctrl+C, Esc&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;[[&amp;#34; + document.</description>

      <title>Generating org-mode Outlines for wikiHow Articles</title>

      <description>Recently I found some great articles on wikiHow, then I want to keep notes of them in org-mode files.&#xA;At first, I manually copied the ToC of articles, but soon I found it&amp;#39;s tedious and takes a lot of time. Today I wrote a requests-based Python script to help me extract the ToCs (Table of Content) into org-mode outlines. It takes two arguments, the first one is the URL, the second one is the containing heading&amp;#39;s level for the generated ToC in org-mode.</description>
