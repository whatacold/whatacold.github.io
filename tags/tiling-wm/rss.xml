      <description>I used to manage SSH connection with such GUI apps as MobaXterm, when I wrote code on Windows at work. As I changed my workflow to use a tiling window manager in a VirtualBox guest OS, I continued to improve my way of managing SSH connections, which I want to share here if you don&amp;#39;t know yet.
 At first, I baked a helper Python script, which I named as qssh for &amp;#34;quick ssh&amp;#34;, to help me assemble ssh arguments for me(such as username, Ip, port, etc.</description>

      <description>I have been really enjoying the more concentration workflow qtile, a tiling window manager, brings me, since I started using it a few months ago. I am more focus on the current task now as all the windows I care about are laid out on the same screen.
 As I get more used to qtile at every day&amp;#39;s work, I noticed that I became more depend on short-life terminal sessions.</description>

      <description>For having been using GNOME for quite a long time, I was considering trying some tiling window managers to see what it&amp;#39;s like a few weeks ago. Along the way, I found a nice window manager written in Python: Qtile, what interests me most is that it&amp;#39;s a hackable window manager, which makes it flexible to extend or change its behaviors.
 Well, switching to use a tiling window manager is far simpler than I thought.</description>
