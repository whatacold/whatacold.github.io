      <description>Adjust the screen brightness in Emacs    If you&amp;#39;re using i3wm on Linux, how do you adjust the laptop&amp;#39;s screen brightness?
 Most of the time, I use the laptop with an external monitor. But when I am out, I have no monitors. And it seems no easy way to adjust the brightness in i3wm. Being too bright or dim is terrible for the eyes.
 Recently, I found a command-line tool called brightnessctl, which can adjust the brightness in a terminal.</description>

      <description>I barely use notifications, but recently I think it&amp;#39;s a valuable way to remind me things like helping me nurture habits, or to notify me of emergencies like a critically low laptop battery.
 So I try to integrate notifications to org-mode and Emacs today.
 The org-notify package from org-contrib (install it by (package-install &amp;#39;org-contrib) ) could do this job easily before, so I first test it in the minibuffer with (org-notify &amp;#34;test&amp;#34;).</description>

      <description>I used to manage SSH connection with such GUI apps as MobaXterm, when I wrote code on Windows at work. As I changed my workflow to use a tiling window manager in a VirtualBox guest OS, I continued to improve my way of managing SSH connections, which I want to share here if you don&amp;#39;t know yet.
 At first, I baked a helper Python script, which I named as qssh for &amp;#34;quick ssh&amp;#34;, to help me assemble ssh arguments for me(such as username, Ip, port, etc.</description>

      <description>I have been really enjoying the more concentration workflow qtile, a tiling window manager, brings me, since I started using it a few months ago. I am more focus on the current task now as all the windows I care about are laid out on the same screen.
 As I get more used to qtile at every day&amp;#39;s work, I noticed that I became more depend on short-life terminal sessions.</description>

      <description>For having been using GNOME for quite a long time, I was considering trying some tiling window managers to see what it&amp;#39;s like a few weeks ago. Along the way, I found a nice window manager written in Python: Qtile, what interests me most is that it&amp;#39;s a hackable window manager, which makes it flexible to extend or change its behaviors.
 Well, switching to use a tiling window manager is far simpler than I thought.</description>
