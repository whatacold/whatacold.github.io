      <description>I used to manage SSH connection with such GUI apps as MobaXterm, when I wrote code on Windows at work. As I changed my workflow to use a tiling window manager in a VirtualBox guest OS, I continued to improve my way of managing SSH connections, which I want to share here if you don&amp;#39;t know yet.
 At first, I baked a helper Python script, which I named as qssh for &amp;#34;quick ssh&amp;#34;, to help me assemble ssh arguments for me(such as username, Ip, port, etc.</description>

      <description>There are times that I need to open many web pages of some specific websites within a browser, and there are so many tabs that I can&amp;#39;t efficiently access one of them, as their favicons are all the same.
 So I tried to find a way to rename their titles, preferably in a lightweight way, so that I can spot them quickly with eyes.
 The first thought came into my mind was to find some extensions to do the job.</description>

      <description>If you ever wonder how to plot ER diagrams in plain text, you may have already heard of erd. It&amp;#39;s a cool command line program written by Andrew Gallant in Haskell, to &amp;#34;compile&amp;#34; plain text files into nicely looking images, leveraging the power of GraphViz.
 I&amp;#39;ve used erd for some time, it&amp;#39;s cool and the syntax is quite simple. It&amp;#39;s also quite simple to install it on Linux, just install GraphViz and erd itself, by following the instructions in the README page.</description>
