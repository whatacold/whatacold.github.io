      <description>To get my hands dirty with Clojure, I am trying to find or implement Clojure&amp;#39;s string functions in the sense of Python. Python has powerful string APIs, and I also want to see how powerful Clojure could be in this field. That would be interesting.
 As shown in the cheatsheet, Clojure has implemented most of them, and there are some that I have to implement myself, like title-case.</description>

      <description>These days I like to write scripts for some tasks in Python instead of shell. One important reason I think that&amp;#39;s because Python is powerful at string manipulation.
 Recently I&amp;#39;m learning Clojure, and I&amp;#39;m trying to find similar ways in Clojure, one of them is s.title() for getting a title-cased version of a string. For example,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;#39; Hello world&amp;#39;.title() &amp;#39; Hello World&amp;#39;   How to do that in Clojure?</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m used to learning by practicing, so when I learned Clojure, I always kept an eye on chances to write code in it.
 Scripting is an excellent field to practice, but the experience is not so good. On the one hand, it&amp;#39;s too hacky to wrap Clojure code in a shell script with the shell bang. On the other hand, the startup time of JVM is too long to hurt the user experience.</description>
