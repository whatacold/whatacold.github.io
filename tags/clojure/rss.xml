      <description>In case you donâ€™t know it, we can use raw strings, like embedding JS code, in hiccup.&#xA;I just found out we can use raw to prevent strings from getting escaped. I used to have to define a dedicated app.js for that, which would need an extra HTTP request.&#xA;Hiccup raw in action Looking back, I shouldâ€™ve found this at the very beginning, as itâ€™s just mentioned on its GitHub homepage, but somehow I missed it.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, we may want a few examples of a Clojure API for inspiration while developing, especially when reading other people&amp;#39;s or open source code.&#xA;With Cider in Emacs, we can run M-x cider-doc to see the docstring for the symbol. We can even use M-x cider-clojuredocs for some examples if the symbol is from the language core.&#xA;Running M-x cider-clojuredocs I happened to find this command recently. I bet I was not the only one who didn&amp;#39;t know it, thus I&amp;#39;m sharing.</description>

      <description> So you&amp;#39;re more than excited to find out how Clojure&amp;#39;s thread macros can make code clean and concise, you just love it! But at some point you&amp;#39;ll be trapped a bit as the threaded argument&amp;#39;s positions are inconsistent using -&amp;gt; or -&amp;gt;&amp;gt;.&#xA;Luckily, you can use as-&amp;gt; to place the argument wherever you like:&#xA;Lambda vs. thread-as </description>

      <title>ðŸ¥· Clojure Pro Tip 2: group-by</title>
      <link>https://whatacold.io/blog/2025-04-18-clojure-group-by/</link>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s amazingly easy to group things in Clojure. The language core provides a group-by function directly. Together with many built-in functions or key functions, it creates a ton of possibilities, and we can also bake our grouping function if none is satisfying.&#xA;group-by Example from Clojure Koans.</description>

      <title>ðŸ¥· Clojure Pro Tip 1: the Discard Reader Symbol</title>
      <link>https://whatacold.io/blog/2025-04-05-clojure-tip-discard-reader-symbol/</link>

      <guid>https://whatacold.io/blog/2025-04-05-clojure-tip-discard-reader-symbol/</guid>
      <description>In Clojure, we can use comment (aka Rich Comment Blocks) for tests or experiments in development. However, since a comment evaluates to nil, you may run into surprising results or even errors if you misuse it.&#xA;Comment vs. Discard In these scenarios, you may tend to use ; to comment them out, but a better choice is to use the discard reader symbol #_.</description>

      <title>Rewrite of a Flask Web App in Clojure</title>

      <guid>https://whatacold.io/blog/2025-02-22-flask-clojure-rewrite/</guid>
      <description>Intro A few years ago, I made a simple web app in Flask to deal with some text processing problems from my daily work. It has two main features:&#xA;Feature #1: generating compile_commands.json for GNU Makefile projects written in C/C++ using the output of the make command. Because, unlike CMake, the make command can&amp;#39;t generate it. Feature #2: extract text using Python regex. It&amp;#39;s handy when I feel like sed/awk/grep&amp;#39;s line-oriented processing isn&amp;#39;t enough for the task at hand.</description>

      <title>Constructing Clojure Maps Conditionally</title>

      <guid>https://whatacold.io/blog/2025-01-05-construct-a-map-clojure/</guid>
      <description>I was wondering how to construct a multi-key map conditionally while I was coding in Clojure. Ideally, I would like to build it &amp;#34;in one pass&amp;#34; like {:bar 2 (when true :baz 3)}, but from what I had collected from Blue Sky, it seemed that&amp;#39;s impossible, or it&amp;#39;s just not an idiomatic way to program like that in Clojure. (Or, is this just a side effect of writing too much imperative code?</description>

      <description>Here is the outline for my cider tutorial on YouTube, covering basic things you need to know to get started with cider, and starting exploring the fun of clojure programming with the REPL-driven programming approach.&#xA;Jack In to a REPL C-c M-j (cider-jack-in-clj) start a nREPL and jack in. It works in a project or with a sole .clj file. M-x cider-connect-clj run the command and then fill in hostname and port.</description>

      <title>A Few Quick Notes About babashka/fs</title>

      <description>Recently I&amp;#39;ve used babashka/fs a little bit, here are some quick notes for it:&#xA;Path vs File. Use Path whenever possible, according to this SO answer to &amp;#34;Java: Path vs File&amp;#34;. This is actually Java related. It&amp;#39;s ok to use a path as a key for a clojure map. At my first try, I somehow came to the conclusion that it&amp;#39;s not ok, while I was refactoring the live reload for clay.</description>

      <title>Doing Unit test in Clojure Is Easy</title>
      <link>https://whatacold.io/blog/2024-11-27-clojure-unit-test/</link>

      <description>While refactoring the live reload feature of Clay, I realized I&amp;#39;d better break long functions into smaller and functional ones (as many as I can), which is also a common practice in the clojure community.&#xA;Small pure functions not only are easy to verify on the development process (using a REPL), but also are easy to test. And unit tests are easy to write in clojure, just use deftest from clojure.</description>

      <description>While developing the live reload feature for Clay, a minimalistic Clojure tool for data visualization and literate programming, I found that it constantly takes ~1 minute for beholder to watch a directory. After some code inspect, I was still having no idea why it happened.&#xA;So I decided to use a profiler to find out what&amp;#39;s going one under the hood, and Google immediately took me to clj-async-profiler. It&amp;#39;s easy to set up following its basic usage docs:</description>

      <title>Adding Clojure Dependencies from the Command Line</title>

      <description>While debugging a live reload issue of Clay a few days ago, I learned from Markus Agwin that we can actually add dependencies on the fly from the command line, just like this: clj -Sdeps &amp;#34;{:deps {org.scicloj/clay {:mvn/version \&amp;#34;2-beta21\&amp;#34;}}}&amp;#34;.&#xA;Even better, we can add dependency from a Git repo and specify the commit hash: clj -Sdeps &amp;#34;{:deps {io.github.scicloj/clay {:git/url \&amp;#34;https://github.com/scicloj/clay.git\&amp;#34; :git/sha \&amp;#34;35a46541db66ae6b4e1af628b7c24c42d3be418f\&amp;#34;}}}&amp;#34;, which is really helpful for experimenting and verifying things.</description>

      <title>Bitten by Lazy Sequence of map</title>

      <description>While impletenting the live reload feature for Clay a few weeks ago, unfortunately, I was bitten by the laziness of map. It seems quite obvious we all know that its result is a lazy sequence, but I just can&amp;#39;t help fall into the &amp;#34;trap&amp;#34;.&#xA;At that time I was adding a vector to keep track of all beholder instances watching file changes in user specified directories. So then when it&amp;#39;s time to stop all the watchers, I used something like to achieve the goal:</description>

      <description>While adding the live reload feature to Clay, I encountered a problem of applying anonymous functions to thread macros. For example, below is a simple snippet trying to wrap the input directory as a vector with the help of thread macro, but surprisingly, it errors out. After some searching, I figured out that I need to put the anonymous function into another pair of parentheses:&#xA;(-&amp;gt; &amp;#34;/tmp/&amp;#34; #(if (vector? %) % [%])) ;; =&amp;gt; Syntax error (ClassCastException) compiling fn* at (simple4all.</description>

      <description>While troubleshooting and fixing a live reload bug in Clay today, which required to start a minimal Clojure environment, I figured out how to start a nREPL from the command line.&#xA;Instead of using M-x cider-jack-in-clj directly from Emacs, actually we can manully bring up an nREPL with this: clj -Sdeps &amp;#34;{:deps {org.scicloj/clay {:mvn/version \&amp;#34;2-beta21\&amp;#34;} cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version \&amp;#34;0.50.2\&amp;#34;}}}&amp;#34; -m nrepl.cmdline --middleware &amp;#34;[cider.nrepl/cider-middleware]&amp;#34; (The clay part is only necessary for this debugging), and then connect to this nREPL using the Emacs command M-x cider-connect-clj.</description>

      <description>As a practice, I managed to illustrate Clojure files using illustrate.clj, but my original idea was to annotate org-mode files of blogs. It&amp;#39;s not uncommon that a blog post has some code snippets.&#xA;But it missed the feature until last night, as I wasn&amp;#39;t sure how to implement it appropriately before and didn&amp;#39;t have enough time.&#xA;For example, I may have an org-mode like this:&#xA;sum of two numbers: #+begin_src clojure (+ 1 2) #+end_src I want to have a result comment ((;; =&amp;gt; 3)) after each top-level form after using illustrate.</description>

      <description>To get my hands dirty with Clojure, I am trying to find or implement Clojure&amp;#39;s string functions in the sense of Python. Python has powerful string APIs, and I also want to see how powerful Clojure could be in this field. That would be interesting.&#xA;As shown in the cheatsheet, Clojure has implemented most of them, and there are some that I have to implement myself, like title-case.&#xA;Along the way, I found it was a little cumbersome to append the evaluation result and the result of calling them, for example,</description>

      <description>These days I like to write scripts for some tasks in Python instead of shell. One important reason I think that&amp;#39;s because Python is powerful at string manipulation.&#xA;Recently I&amp;#39;m learning Clojure, and I&amp;#39;m trying to find similar ways in Clojure, one of them is s.title() for getting a title-cased version of a string. For example,&#xA;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;#39; Hello world&amp;#39;.title() &amp;#39; Hello World&amp;#39; How to do that in Clojure? To make the problem simple, let&amp;#39;s assume that the input string only has letters and spaces, that is, [a-zA-Z ] in regex pattern.</description>

      <description>Python string APIs are powerful and concise, that is an important reason I use it to do a lot of scripting these days, join, split, strip, to name a few.&#xA;Since I am learning Clojure recently, I am wondering, how is string manipulation like in Clojure and how to implement equivalent ones?&#xA;I think it&amp;#39;s an excellent opportunity to get familiar with Clojure. Before diving into the implementation, how to declare a multi-line string?</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m used to learning by practicing, so when I learned Clojure, I always kept an eye on chances to write code in it.&#xA;Scripting is an excellent field to practice, but the experience is not so good. On the one hand, it&amp;#39;s too hacky to wrap Clojure code in a shell script with the shell bang. On the other hand, the startup time of JVM is too long to hurt the user experience.</description>
