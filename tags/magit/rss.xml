      <description>Sometimes, I need to revert a series of commits that I&amp;#39;ve already pushed, doing a git hard reset (git reset --hard) is not an option, as someone may already have new commits based on mine.&#xA;For example, assume that I&amp;#39;ve made a few commits like below:&#xA;65a2c62 * commit 10 25cad43 * commit 9 72ad583 * commit 8 ceebf9a * commit 7 acf8a11 * commit 6 28d526f * commit 5 63af1e2 * commit 4 982c71c * commit 3 0fb4c2d * commit 2 acf9da1 * commit 1 b5f9933 * commit 0 For whatever reason, I need to &amp;#34;drop&amp;#34; the changes made by commit 6 to commit 10, that is, go back to &amp;#34;commit 5&amp;#34; without deleting these commits.</description>
