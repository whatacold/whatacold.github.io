      <description>If you are new to Emacs, you may run into some errors, especially after you copied some elisp snippets from the Internet or elsewhere. Don&amp;#39;t panic! It happens, it&amp;#39;s just part of the learning process. Even an experienced Emacs user could run into there issues from time to time.&#xA;Photo by Mike Newbry on Unsplash But in order to ease the pain, I will introduce a bunch of Emacs built-in features to help you troubleshoot and eventually solve the problems by yourself in this post.</description>

      <description>There are many packages of Emacs that leverage subprocesses to do their jobs, Magit, eglot, elpy, to name a few. And there are times that a subprocess doesn&amp;#39;t work as expected, for example, Magit is slow, and you&amp;#39;re sure that it&amp;#39;s ok when running git commands on shell. So how to spot these problems effectively and quickly?&#xA;The problem is that we don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on exactly, so here I want to share a few Elisp advices to make the subprocess creating visible, and print the exact program and its arguments to the *Message* buffer.</description>
