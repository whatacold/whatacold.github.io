      <description>There are many packages of Emacs that leverage subprocesses to do their jobs, Magit, eglot, elpy, to name a few. And there are times that a subprocess doesn&amp;#39;t work as expected, for example, Magit is slow, and you&amp;#39;re sure that it&amp;#39;s ok when running git commands on shell. So how to spot these problems effectively and quickly?&#xA;The problem is that we don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on exactly, so here I want to share a few Elisp advices to make the subprocess creating visible, and print the exact program and its arguments to the *Message* buffer.</description>
