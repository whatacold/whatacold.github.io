      <description>When I started to use Hugo to write this blog last year, I noticed that there is an easy-hugo package of Emacs that there are many people use it. So I installed it that time, but I didn&amp;#39;t use many of its features along the way. The only command I used was easy-hugo-current-time. I used it to update the Hugo timestamps manually as in the format of 2022-10-15T09:45:35+08:00.&#xA;My most desirable feature is to use it to select tags easily when I start to write a new post, but I never got it to work.</description>
