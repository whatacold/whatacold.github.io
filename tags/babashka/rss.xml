      <description>To get my hands dirty with Clojure, I am trying to find or implement Clojure&amp;#39;s string functions in the sense of Python. Python has powerful string APIs, and I also want to see how powerful Clojure could be in this field. That would be interesting.
 As shown in the cheatsheet, Clojure has implemented most of them, and there are some that I have to implement myself, like title-case.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m used to learning by practicing, so when I learned Clojure, I always kept an eye on chances to write code in it.
 Scripting is an excellent field to practice, but the experience is not so good. On the one hand, it&amp;#39;s too hacky to wrap Clojure code in a shell script with the shell bang. On the other hand, the startup time of JVM is too long to hurt the user experience.</description>
