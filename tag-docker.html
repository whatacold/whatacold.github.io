<p>
One of Docker's use cases is to set up identical development environments easily and quickly for a dev team.
Recently, I had an opportunity to give it a try, and build Docker images for <a href="https://github.com/qtile/qtile">Qtile</a>, as it didn't have one yet as I get involved. With the images, it's easy to set up the environment to easily run the tests, and build the documentation.
</p>

<p>
The best way to have a basic idea of Docker is to think it like a chroot environment, as Chris Tankersley stated in his <a href="https://leanpub.com/dockerfordevs">Docker for Developers</a>.
And two basic concepts of Docker are image and container, containers to images are what objects to classes as in OOP terminology.
</p>

<p>
The instructions for building a Docker image are put in a <code>Dockerfile</code>, every command builds a new layer on top of the previous one so that I can build my image "on the shoulders of giants".
</p>

<p>
The final Dockerfiles for testing Qtile and building its documentation are hosted at <a href="https://github.com/whatacold/qtile-docker">https://github.com/whatacold/qtile-docker</a>, there is a brief README there about how to build them and use them.</p>
