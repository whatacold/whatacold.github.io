<p>
There are times that I need to open many web pages of some specific websites within a browser, there are so many tabs that I can't efficiently access one of them, as their favicons are all the same.
</p>

<p>
So I tried to find a way to rename their titles, preferably in a lightweight way, so that I can spot them quickly with my eyes.
</p>

<p>
The first thought came into my mind was to find some extensions to do the job. It was easy to install one with no time. But I was not very happy with the experience. It seems that it keeps the rule of renaming titles based on the URL so that the title will always be renamed if I refreshing it, which is not what I want. I'd rather want to do it in an ad-hoc way.
</p>

<p>
Then I thought maybe it can be simply done with a bookmarklet, nevertheless, it's just a simple JavaScript statement of <code>document.title = "nice-title"</code>. With that in my mind, it didn't take me much time to write this bookmarklet:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-js">javascript:
(<span style="color: #2c3e50; font-style: italic;">function</span> ()
 {
     <span style="color: #2c3e50; font-style: italic;">var</span> <span style="color: #3498db;">title</span> = window.prompt(<span style="color: #16a085;">"Enter new title: "</span>, <span style="color: #16a085;">""</span>);
     <span style="color: #2c3e50; font-style: italic;">if</span> (title)
     {
         document.title= title;
     }
 })()
</pre>
