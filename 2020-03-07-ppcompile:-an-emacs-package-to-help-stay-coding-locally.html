<p>
If you are a C/C++ programmer like me, you may experience jumping around different machines to write and compile your code, or you may write code on different machines for different projects, and scp/rsync/ftp the projects around. It works, but it's a bit tedious and takes too much burden on our brains.
</p>

<p>
For example, say I have two projects that should be compiled on their compiling machines respectively. There are two obvious workflows for writing code for them "simultaneously":
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Write code locally, rsync files to their compiling machine and compile them, fix errors according to the compiling result.
</p>

<p>
Pros: I have only one coding environment to maintain, and I have full control of it. Install packages? Start some services? No problem, just a few commands.
</p>

<p>
Cons: I have to sync the source code, spot the errors by my eyes and fix them accordingly.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Write code on the compiling machine, compile them and fix errors locally there, taking the advantage of <code>M-x next-error</code>.
</p>

<p>
Pros: <code>M-x next-error</code> works like a charm to fix errors, just a piece of cake. Eye friendly.
</p>

<p>
Cons: Several Emacs environment to maintain, and I don't always have the root privilege.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
So I was wondering if there is a way to take the good part of both approaches so that I have full privilege and fix compiling errors locally as if I were compiling locally? Well, the answer was yes, and <a href="https://github.com/whatacold/ppcompile">ppcompile</a> was my solution for it.
</p>

<p>
<code>ppcompile</code> stands for ping-pong compile, as it works like playing ping-pong. First, it rsync's the files to the compiling machines ("ping"). Second, it gets the result back ("pong") and gets them fixed locally.
</p>

<p>
It works now, and I hope it helps you too. :)
