<p>
Last week I came into a problem with Git, that I can't fetch the remote branch that I just pushed to. It was so weird because I can push it. It never happens before, and it happened when I was in a rush to rebase my code, as someone in my team pushed his code.
</p>

<p>
After searching, it seemed that the configuration of <code>fetch</code> of that repo was different(this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11623862/fetch-in-git-doesnt-get-all-branches">Stack Overflow</a> thread for example) than before, it was specified that only <code>master</code> can be fetched. It worked after I changed it to <code>+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</code>.
</p>

<p>
I reflected why it happened after work, the only difference I can remember was that I clone that repo with the option <code>--depth &lt;N&gt;</code>, that is, it was a shallow clone to save some disk space.
</p>

<p>
Today I had some time at hand, and I confirmed that the option is the cause by reading the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone">git-clone</a>(1) manpage, it notes that:
</p>
<pre class="example">
--depth &lt;depth&gt;
    Create a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number of commits. Implies --single-branch unless
    --no-single-branch is given to fetch the histories near the tips of all branches.
</pre>

<p>
Let's demonstrate it by cloning my dotfiles repo with different options, and it shows clearly that Git will only fetch <code>master</code> of the remote repo if only specifying <code>--depth</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ cd /tmp/
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/whatacold/dotfiles.git dotfiles-depth1
$ git clone --no-single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/whatacold/dotfiles.git dotfiles-no-single-branch
$ git clone https://github.com/whatacold/dotfiles.git dotfiles-full

$ grep <span style="color: #16a085;">'remote "origin"'</span> -A 2 dotfiles-depth1/.git/config 
[remote <span style="color: #16a085;">"origin"</span>]
    <span style="color: #3498db;">url</span> = https://github.com/whatacold/dotfiles.git
    <span style="color: #3498db;">fetch</span> = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master

$ grep <span style="color: #16a085;">'remote "origin"'</span> -A 2 dotfiles-no-single-branch/.git/config 
[remote <span style="color: #16a085;">"origin"</span>]
    <span style="color: #3498db;">url</span> = https://github.com/whatacold/dotfiles.git
    <span style="color: #3498db;">fetch</span> = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

$ grep <span style="color: #16a085;">'remote "origin"'</span> -A 2 dotfiles-full/.git/config
[remote <span style="color: #16a085;">"origin"</span>]
    <span style="color: #3498db;">url</span> = https://github.com/whatacold/dotfiles.git
    <span style="color: #3498db;">fetch</span> = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I don't know why <code>--single-branch</code> should be implied by default, at least for me, I just want to fetch all the remote branches.
